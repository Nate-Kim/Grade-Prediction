# Web UI for ECS 171 Group Project

## Setup
- Install docker

### For working on frontend/backend separately:
- Frontend: Follow setup instructions in `frontend/README.md`
- Backend: Follow setup instructions in `backend/README.md`

*These are separate projects: ideally it would be good to have different git repos for them. Execute commands for each in their respective directory*

## Build everything
`docker-compose up --build`

*This shouldn't require setting up frontend and backend separately, but I haven't tested it. I think only docker is required*

## TODO
- registry
- deployment
